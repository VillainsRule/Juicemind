## Juicemind
a juicemind utility kit for live games. for educational purposes, as always.

### included in this kit:
1. console scripts to get answers
2. userscripts to instant answer, get other people's answers wrong, etc
3. join newly created rooms w/ name "exploit"

### the exploit
this is similar to what gliz did with blooket; it just polls firebase to get new rooms and then joins them. this is why you secure your firebase instance.

i emailed juicemind to inform them there were exploits over a month ago w/ no response, so i'm assuming they just don't care, so here you go!
